# csp_solver
A small python program that solves constraint satisfaction problems and shows the steps taken in the process.
Run via the command line using

python main.py <problem.var> <problem.con> <none/fc>

Where the arguments are a file containing the variables and their possible domains, a file containing all constraints, and a setting that can be none or fc (forward checking).
Sample problems are included in the samples folder. The .out files contain the expected solution.
